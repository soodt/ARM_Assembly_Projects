@ Below is a sample sequence that you can modify to test different
@   features of your program
@
@ Remember: the sequence is stored in memory as the size (number of)
@   elements, followed by the elements themselves. In the example
@   below, the size is 10 and the elememts are
@   {5, 1, 9, 7, 4, 4, 8, 4, 5, 3}

  .word  5                             @ size
  .word  1,5,2,5,2,   @ values

  @ For the above test sequence, the average is 5 and
  @   the mode is 4.
